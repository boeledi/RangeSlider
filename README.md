## Getting Started

You should ensure that you add the following dependency in your Flutter project.
```yaml
dependencies:
 flutter_range_slider: "^1.6.0"
```

You should then run `flutter packages upgrade` or update your packages in IntelliJ.

In your Dart code, to use it:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_range_slider/flutter_range_slider.dart' as frs;
```

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**
<br/>
> As of version 1.7, Flutter Framework also has its own RangeSlider.
> If you want to keep working with this library, you need to import the package, using an alias e.g. frs.
> Then, your need to prefix both RangeSlider and RangeSliderCallback with this alias (frs.RangeSlider and frs.RangeSliderCallback)
